  "Description": "The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing tire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote . agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travei constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.",
  "SubRaceDescription": "As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You're inclined to be affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and thus are the most common variety. Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings. and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk. these halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.",
