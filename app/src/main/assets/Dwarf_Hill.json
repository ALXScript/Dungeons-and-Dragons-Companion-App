  "Description": "Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and ores-lhese common threads unite all dwarves.",
  "SubRaceDescription": "As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faenln in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the Oragonlance setting.",
